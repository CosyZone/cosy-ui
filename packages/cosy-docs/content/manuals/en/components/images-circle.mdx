# ImagesCircle

## Introduction

3D perspective image display component that simulates images moving toward the viewer from a distance. The center image "moves fastest" and appears largest and closest, while side images "move slower" and appear smaller and farther, creating a strong sense of spatial depth.

Component features:

- Realistic 3D perspective effects simulating depth space
- Center image largest and clearest, side images gradually smaller and blurred
- Smart 3D position calculation algorithm
- Support for multiple images in 3D arrangement (odd numbers only)
- Subtle rotation and opacity changes enhance depth perception
- Responsive design with mobile performance optimization

**Important Note:** The component only accepts an odd number of images (minimum 3) to ensure a clear center image. If an even number of images is provided, the component will display an error message.
