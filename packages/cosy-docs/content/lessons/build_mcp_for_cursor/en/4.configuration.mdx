title: Configuring MCP Server in Cursor
---

# {frontmatter.title}

In the previous chapters, we successfully created an MCP Server. Now, we need to tell Cursor how to find and use this server. This is done through a configuration file.

## Creating the Configuration File

1. First, open any project in Cursor (it can be a new project or an existing one).

2. Create a `.cursor` folder in the project root (if it doesn't exist):

   ```bash
   mkdir .cursor
   ```

3. Create an `mcp.json` file in the `.cursor` folder:

   ```bash
   touch .cursor/mcp.json
   ```

4. Add the following configuration to the `mcp.json` file:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "about-me": {
         "command": "uv",
         "args": [
           "--directory",
           "/Users/{your_username}/Code/Playground/build_mcp_for_cursor/project",
           "run",
           "main.py"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

## Understanding the Configuration

Let's break down each part of this configuration file:

1. **mcpServers**

   - This is the main section that defines all MCP servers

2. **about-me**

   - This is our server name, which must match the name in `FastMCP("about-me")`
   - You can change this name, but ensure it matches in both places

3. **command**

   - Specifies which command to use to run the server
   - We're using `uv`, our package manager

4. **args**
   - List of command arguments, including:
     - `--directory`: Specifies the project directory
     - Project path: You need to replace this with your actual project path
     - `run`: The uv run command
     - `main.py`: The Python file to run

## Enabling the MCP Service

After creating the configuration file, we need to enable the service in Cursor:

1. Open Cursor Settings

   - Windows/Linux: Click the gear icon in the bottom left or use `Ctrl + ,`
   - macOS: Click the gear icon in the bottom left or use `Cmd + ,`

2. In the Settings panel:
   - Find and click "MCP" in the left sidebar
   - You should see our "about-me" service
   - Click the "Enabled" option to enable the service

## Verifying the Service

Now we can test if our service is working:

1. Open Cursor's Agent mode

   - Click the AI icon in the sidebar
   - Or use the keyboard shortcut to open the AI panel

2. Try these test questions:

   ```
   Q: What's my name?
   A: [AI will call get_user_name() and return "Lucas Lee"]

   Q: How old am I?
   A: [AI will call get_user_age() and return 30]
   ```

If you receive the correct answers, congratulations! Your MCP Server is configured and working properly!

## Common Issues

1. **Can't Find MCP Settings?**

   - Ensure your Cursor is up to date
   - Try restarting Cursor IDE

2. **Service Appears Grayed Out?**

   - Check if the configuration file format is correct
   - Ensure the project path is correct and accessible

3. **Agent Can't Get Information?**
   - Make sure the service is properly enabled
   - Check if the Python service is running
   - Look at Cursor's log information

## Next Steps

Now that you've successfully configured and tested your MCP Server, you can:

- Add more custom tools
- Modify the returned information
- Implement more complex functionality
- Explore other possibilities with MCP servers
