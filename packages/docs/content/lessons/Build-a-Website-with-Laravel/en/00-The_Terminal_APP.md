## Architect

Now that you have a computer, how you operate it?

Of course through various applications.

These apps actually operate the computer through commands.

### Say Hello to the Terminal APP

Every macOS user has a Terminal app. It is the most powerful tool in our arsenal. You can operate all the commands through the Terminal app.

I recommend that you pin the terminal app to the dock, as you will be using it frequently in the future.
